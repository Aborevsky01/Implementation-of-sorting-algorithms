### What is a Sorting Algorithm? 
 It is a final combination of several instructions, describing a process for rearranging list elements according to a comparison operator. The latter I used to set the new order within the data structure. For example, in this particular investigation the final lists will include only non decreasing  order.

The amount of information flows expands rapidly, so it is necessary to sort them all, in order to make the work with data more convenient, less time consuming and the knowledge more understandable and open for public.
